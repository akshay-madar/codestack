Here, I try to implement machine learning algorithms using linear algebra, normal equations, and numpy without using in-built python libraries like sklearn. A full understanding of the underlying mathematics is crucial for a holistic understanding of machine learning concepts. You can also find some of my personal notes where I briefly summarize the statistical concepts.

### Some explored concepts:
  1) Gradient Descent 
  2) Linear/Logistic Regression
  3) Mixed Integer Programming (optimization)
