## What is codestack?
Here you will find the scope of my indulgence in data science and machine learning:

  1) ML/DL Projects - academic and personal
  2) Leetcode and Hackerrank solutions for several coding problems that I have practiced over time
  3) Web scraping projects
  4) Statistical Learning in Python - implemented underlying mathematics of ML models from scratch in python without in-built libraries

I love learning new things, and my GitHub repo will always be a work in progress! I intend to continue my exploration in the fields of data science, machine learning and business intelligence, while also focussing on business applications that can be leveraged from the derived insights. I believe in harnessing data for the following 3 reasons:
  - make human life better 
  - optimize business performance
  - commercialize data opportunities

### A bit about myself:
I am a graduate student at Purdue University, pursuing MS in Business Analytics from Krannert School of Management (class of 2020). Most recently, I worked for Wipro Limited in India, as a Data Scientist, getting my hands dirty with large data sets for ETL and predictive analytics solutions for clients pertaining to BFSI industry. My strengths include Customer Analytics, Ecommerce Analytics, Marketing Analytics, Financial Analytics and Business Intelligence.

With 2+ years of work experience in analytics under my belt, and the skills I have gained and polished while at Purdue, I am looking for data driven roles at organizations which share my passion of harnessing data for insights.
