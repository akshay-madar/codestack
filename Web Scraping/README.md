### About:
Here you will find my web scraping projects. I have scrapped data from several websites, for use for further analysis. I have extensively used string manipulation, BeautifulSoup and Selenium for this purpose. I looked at the following web sites for scraping of key data points:
* SEC Edgar company filings
* Yelp
* An online English quotes catalog

Additionaly, I have employed techniques like headless browsers and XPath parsing to overcome challenges from repeated request hits to web servers for HTML source code. I am also exploring the idea of [ansynchronous web scraping](https://github.com/akshay-madar/codestack/blob/master/Web%20Scraping/Asynchronous%20Web%20Scraping.pdf) to make the process faster and more scalable.
