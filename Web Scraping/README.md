### About:
Here you will find my web scraping projects. I have scrapped data from several websites, for use for further analysis. I have extensively used string manipulation, BeautifulSoup and Selenium for this purpose.

Additionaly, I have employed techniques like headless browsers XPath parsing to overcome challenges from repeated request hits to web servers for HTML source code. I am also exploring the idea of ansynchronous web scraping to make the process faster and more scalable.
